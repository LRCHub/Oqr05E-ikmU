Well I know
what you want from me
You want someone to be
Your reflection,
your bitter deception
Setting you free
So you take what you want
and leave
Who made you like this?
Who encrypted your dark gospel
in body language?
Synapses snap back
in blissful language
Tell me you met me
in past lives, past life
Past what might be eating me
from the inside, darling
Half of a rhythm, half deity
Glitches in the cold or gaps
in a strange dream
Tell me you guessed my future
and it mapped onto your fantasy
Turn me into your mannequin
and I'll turn you
into my puppet queen
Won't you come and dance
in the dark with me?
Show me what you are,
I am desperate to know
Nobody better than
the perfect enemy
Digital demons make the night
feel heavenly
Make it real
'Cause anything's better than
the way I feel right now
I can offer you
a blacklit paradise
Diamonds in the trees,
pentagrams in the night sky
Lipstick, chemtrails,
red flags, pink nails
With one eye on the door,
other eye on a rail
Other, other eye following
a scarlet trail
And the last few drops
from the Holy Grail
Now rose-gold chains,
ripped lace, cut glass
Blood stains on the collar means
just don't ask
Be the first to the feast
Let's choke on the past
And take to the broken skies
at last
Diamonds in the trees,
pentagrams in the night sky
Diamonds in the trees,
pentagrams in the night sky
Diamonds in the trees,
pentagrams in the night sky
Diamonds in the trees,
pentagrams in the night sky
Diamonds in the trees,
pentagrams in the night sky
Diamonds in the trees,
pentagrams in the night sky
Diamonds in the trees,
pentagrams in the night sky
Diamonds in the trees,
pentagrams in the night sky
You're gonna watch me ascend
And I know what you want from me
You want the same as me
My redemption, eternal ascension
Setting me free
So I'll take what I want
then leave
You make me wish
I could disappear
You make me wish
I could disappear
